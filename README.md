## Sybill Challenge

I Approached this challenge as if it was an application going to production. Â 

I won't say it's perfect (no production code is), 

but this is representative of something that I would be comfortable releasing to a production environment.

I have broken the application into very tiny + reusable components.

That means, better performance, a faster development speed with tons of money and time saved in the long-run.
